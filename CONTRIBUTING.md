# Contributing

You don't need to be a developer to make a impact on the industry by contributing to the CD Manifesto documentation and
examples, just a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

## Pull requests

To contribute documentation or code, please send us a pull request. 
If you are new to pull requests, read GitHub's [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) guide.

## Community Slack Workspace

[Join the community's Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/minimumcd/shared_invite/zt-x0sq2cvm-Nzu~LuBzg~71_XzHgqiJPQ) to share your voice, experience, and insights as we work to improve outcomes by bringing continuous delivery practices to everyone.

## Working Agreement

Anyone on the core team can review and accept a signature request. Signatories are encouraged to include a preferred form of contact to answer questions, but it is not required.

The core team will gladly accept PRs for updates to the MVP practices if it agrees with the goals of the project. If you would like to suggest updates, the threshold for a practice being required is:

1. It is deemed "fundamental" and works in all contexts
2. The goal of the practice is to amplify feedback, reduce batch size, or reduce toil
3. Not doing it creates unacceptable risk to the end-user in all contexts
4. It can be objectively assessed to be true or false
